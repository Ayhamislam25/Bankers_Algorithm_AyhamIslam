# Bankers_Algorithm
Bankers algorithm in Operating System is used to avoid deadlock and for resource allocation safely to each process in the system. As the name suggests, it is mainly used in the banking system to check whether the loan can be sanctioned to a person or not (Using .NET Framework)
# Banker's Algorithm

Banker's Algorithm is a deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems. This project implements the Banker's Algorithm in C# using the .NET Framework. It allows users to simulate and analyze resource allocation and deadlock avoidance in a multi-process environment.

## Features

- Process creation: Create multiple processes with their resource needs and maximum allocation.
- Resource allocation: Allocate resources to processes based on their request and available resources.
- Deadlock detection: Check for deadlock conditions in the system.
- Deadlock avoidance: Utilize the Banker's Algorithm to prevent deadlock occurrence.
- User-friendly interface: Interactive command-line interface for easy usage.

## Requirements

- .NET Framework (version X.X or higher)
- Visual Studio (version 2019 or higher)

## Installation

1. Download the zip file 
2. Unzip the file
3. open Visual Studio
4. From files > Open project 
5. then select the project named as winform4
6. Request a resource and interact with the windows applicaton to see if there a deadlock or not using bankers algorithm

## Usage

1. Open the command prompt or terminal.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the project using the appropriate command or by executing the compiled executable file.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the Banker's Algorithm simulation.
5. Use the provided commands to create processes, allocate resources, and analyze deadlock conditions.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of how to use the Banker's Algorithm simulation:

1. Create a new process:
create 1 4 5 1

css
Copy code
This command creates a new process with ID 1 and resource needs [4, 5, 2, 3].

2. Allocate resources to a process:
allocate 1 1 2 1 

css
Copy code
This command allocates resources [1, 2, 1, 4] to the process with ID 1.

3. Check for deadlock:
check_deadlock



4. Avoid deadlock using Banker's Algorithm:
avoid_deadlock

vbnet
Copy code
This command applies the Banker's Algorithm to prevent deadlock occurrence.
